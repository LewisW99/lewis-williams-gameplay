I’m a gameplay-focused engineer specialising in player-facing systems and modular gameplay architecture, primarily working in Unreal Engine (C++) and Unity (C#).

My work focuses on systems that sit directly between player intent and game logic — ability systems, progression frameworks, UI-driven decision flows, and real-time feedback mechanisms. I favour event-driven design, clean separation of data and behaviour, and component-based architectures that scale without becoming brittle.

I’m particularly interested in building systems that are easy for designers to iterate on, while remaining performant and maintainable at runtime. Many of my projects emphasise clear data flow, reuse through composition, and avoiding unnecessary coupling between systems.

This site is a curated selection of gameplay systems and technical prototypes that reflect how I approach gameplay engineering problems.
